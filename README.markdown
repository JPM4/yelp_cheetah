yelp_cheetah
============

Cheetah is an open source template engine and code generation tool.

yelp_cheetah is cheetah with everything we don't / shouldn't use removed.

We *really* recommend that you don't choose cheetah for new projects, and certainly not this hacked fork.
If you're already using cheetah in a legacy project though, you might(?) find this useful.
